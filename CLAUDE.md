# Claude Instructions

## Scope
Focus only on files in the `extension/` directory.

## Do Not
- Run or simulate CrossclimbSolver.inspect()
- Attempt to scan LinkedIn's DOM module structure
- Read console diagnostic output as source code

## Key Files
- solver.js: Core orchestration
- dom-inspector.js: DOM discovery (generates large output - read selectively)
